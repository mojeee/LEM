A short instruction to run the code and post-processing is provided: 


1- install CANTERA with all required libraries

2- Replace the 'flameSolver.cpp' and 'flameSolver.h' to ~/src/

3- Install EMBER from repositoy in README with all required libraries ( use scons build and install everytime make a change in 'flameSolver.cpp' and 'flameSolver.h' )

4- Befor run a jon, you need to calculate the flame speed and initial condition 

5- use 'LaminarFlameSpeed.py' to calculate the flame speed

6- then use 'F1_flame_case_for_Triplet.py' and set parameter to obtain initial condition

7- use the data acieved from last step for initial condition

8- set the parameter of the problem in 'config.txt'

9- pu the chemistry file, initial condition file, configuration file and 'K6_LEM.py' in a folder to establish a job
