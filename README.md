Direct calculation of production or consumption rate of all species in the reaction is a severe task, Terefore the statistical method such as RANS or LES is used for calculating species changing rate. In addition, some methods like FLAMELET would be used for the simulation of the interactions between kinetic and turbulence. Terefore the LEM (Linear Eddy Model) had been implemented in the CANTERA (Open Source Library) for simulating one-dimensional and semi one-dimensional ﬂame with diﬀerent kinetic. Also, the viscosity and molecular diﬀusion are implemented similar to a laminar ﬂame, but turbulence eﬀect is implemented by using Triplet Map (TM) (Stochastic advection), and the LEM model can simulate a wide variety of ﬂames with different fuel and physics. In the end, the model creates a database like DNS which uses the statistical results of the database to determine the PDF, SDR, wasting rate of variable, and comparing with DNS and experimental results
